# ipfs-to-ens

Website (dApp) that allows you to easily set an IPFS content hash for your ENS domain.

Converts entered IPFS multihash to 32 byte hex string, finds the resolver for your domain and calls the `setContent` function to store your hash.

Requires MetaMask or equivalent dApp plugin/browser (only tested with MetaMask).
